You want to make a native wrapper for WhatsApp Web (or any web page).

```bash
nativefier 'web.whatsapp.com'
```

You're done.

## Introduction

Nativefier is a command-line tool to easily create a desktop app for any web site
with minimal configuration. Apps are wrapped by [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
(which uses Chromium under the hood) in an OS executable (`.app`, `.exe`, etc)
for use on Windows, macOS and Linux.

I did this because I was tired of having to `âŒ˜-tab` or `alt-tab` to my browser and then search
through the numerous open tabs when I was using [Facebook Messenger](https://messenger.com) or
[Whatsapp Web](https://web.whatsapp.com) ([HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10930718)). Nativefier features:

- Automatically retrieval of app icon / name.
- JavaScript and CSS injection.
- Many more, see the [API docs](API.md) or `nativefier --help`

## Installation

- macOS 10.9+ / Windows / Linux
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) `>= 12.9` and npm `>= 6.9`
- Optional dependencies:
  - [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) or [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) to convert icons.
    Make sure `convert` and `identify` or `gm` are in your system `$PATH`.
  - [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) to package Windows apps under non-Windows platforms.
    Make sure `wine` is in your system `$PATH`.

Then, install Nativefier globally with `npm install -g nativefier`

## Usage

To create a native desktop app for [medium.com](https://medium.com),
simply `nativefier "medium.com"`

Nativefier will try to determine the app name, and well as lots of other options.
If desired, these options can be overwritten. For example, to override the name,
`nativefier --name 'My Medium App' 'medium.com'`

**Read the [API documentation](API.md) or run `nativefier --help`**
to learn about other command-line flags usable to configure the packaged app.

To have high-resolution icons used by default for an app/domain, please
contribute to the [icon repository](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier-icons)!

### Catalog

For a list of build commands contributed by the Nativefier community, see [CATALOG.md file](CATALOG.md).

## Docker

Nativefier is also usable from Docker:

- Pull the image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nativefier/nativefier): `docker pull nativefier/nativefier`
- ... or build it yourself: `docker build -t local/nativefier .`
  (in this case, replace `nativefier/` in the below examples with `local/`)

By default, the command `nativefier --help` will be executed.
To build e.g. a Gmail app to a writable local `~/nativefier-apps`,

```bash
docker run --rm -v ~/nativefier-apps:/target/ nativefier/nativefier https://mail.google.com/ /target/
```

You can pass Nativefier flags, and mount volumes to pass local files. E.g. to use an icon,

```bash
docker run --rm -v ~/my-icons-folder/:/src -v $TARGET-PATH:/target nativefier/nativefier --icon /src/icon.png --name whatsApp -p linux -a x64 https://web.whatsapp.com/ /target/
```

## Troubleshooting

Generally, see [Catalog](CATALOG.md) for ideas & workarounds, and search in existing issues.

### Site says I use an old/unsupported browser

Some sites intentionally block Nativefier (or similar) apps, e.g. [Google](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/issues/831) and [WhatsApp](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/issues/1112).

First, try setting the [`--user-agent`](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/blob/master/API.md#user-agent) to `firefox` or `safari`.

If still broken, see [Catalog](CATALOG.md) for ideas & workarounds, and search in existing issues.

### Videos won't play

This issue comes up for certain sites like [HBO Max](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/issues/1153) and [Udemy](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/issues/1147).

First, try our [`--widevine` flag](API.md#widevine).

If still broken, see [Catalog](CATALOG.md) for ideas & workarounds, and search in existing issues.

### Settings cached between app rebuilds

This issue can occur because the cache of the app and the app itself are kept separate by default. You can try clearing out the cache.

Try delete your app's cache, which can be found in `<your_app_name_lower_case>-nativefier-<random_id>` in your OS's "App Data" directory (for Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `~/.config` , for MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/` , for Windows: `%APPDATA%` or `C:\Users\yourprofile\AppData\Roaming`)
